# weather-wechat-app
A weather broadcast WeChat app with a temperature graph  
  
WeChat mini programs are the mobile apps running on WeChat. It is a MVVM framework similar to Vue.  
  
You need to download WeChat Dev Tools to edit and compile this project. It won't run properly as the backend web api is replaced with a fake URL 'https://demo.com.cn/api/'. This is because the web app I developed is runnin on an Alibaba cloud server I rented myself. The source code of the backend web app is in the repository named as 'weather-web-app'.  
  
The comments in source code are in Chinese since most of the WeChat developers are Chinese.
